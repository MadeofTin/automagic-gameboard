## The Board
Go is played on a 19x19 board. That means there are 361 different possible places you can place a stone. But, sometimes you place a stone in a hole surrounded by other stones. If a board was going to move a piece into that open space it would need to be able to move the surrounding stones to the side while maintaining the state of the board.
